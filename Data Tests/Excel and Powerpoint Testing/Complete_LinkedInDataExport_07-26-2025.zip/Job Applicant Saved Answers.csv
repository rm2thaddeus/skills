Description,"For my bachelor thesis, I developed a novel graphite-based immunosensor aimed at diagnosing Chagas disease. I designed and optimized the sensor using electrochemical techniques, integrating principles of analytical chemistry, nanotechnology, and biosensor development. The project involved assay development and validation—comparing sensor performance with traditional ELISA—and extensive data analysis with OriginPro."
Your title,"Postdoctoral Researcher | Microfluidics, Complex Systems and Synthetic Biology"
Description,"During my JASSO scholarship internship at Nara Institute of Science and Technology, I synthesized a novel photochromic compound that acted as central moiety of a novel self-contained photoacid generator.   I performed comprehensive characterization using NMR, MS/MS, and DFT (Gaussian simulations) to compare theoretical predictions with experimental data. This experience enhanced my skills in organic synthesis, computational modelling, and spectroscopic analysis within photonic molecular sciences."
