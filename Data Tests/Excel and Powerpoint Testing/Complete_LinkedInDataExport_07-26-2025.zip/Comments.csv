I started to code in Linux, back then, whenever I had a problem I needed to read 100 blogs to be able to try one thing in any program I was trying to run. 

In python, it took me like 3 months in my postdoc to calculate a distribution of blobs in a microscopy image. 

Now, all those projects take little more than a prompt, and with the friction being reduced to 0, I started to experiment on top down approaches. 

It works btw, the idea is to clearly document every decision the agent makes by commenting the files it works on. 

This allows to keep the agents on guardrails and allow you to achieve better coding results.

In my case, I started at the release of O1 mini, in a weekend I managed to create a local app that I had been ideating for a while. 

The models almost one shotted that project, I was very happy, but I could not create new features at all, the code always broke and I couldn't advance more than than proof of concept. 

I later tried the same project in cursor and the results were much better, I managed to change some of the components I had designed, but it started to become a nightmare after night 4...

Looking back at it, it makes sense, my prompts for software engineering were garbage and therefore my... Vcode was garbage too!

So I went in to cook and try to map the common pain points someone like me would have.

1-Architecture (Before even starting, explore this in detail, especially if you don't really code)

2-Roadmap (Yeah, normal code doesn't just appear out of nowhere, it is developed step by step, try to emulate that)

3-Versioning (if you don't do GitHub, you're never be able to share your app, improve or unbreak it, install an MCP server for that and learn the lingo to keep track of your things)

Try to put those in the cursor rules, it should change your experience!"

Say you want to use AI to analyze/extract some findings from a paper, but don't really know how...

You can use Promptfessor, he will give you a prompt to try, in a format that is clear both for you and the AI model...

You use that prompt with the paper, it should give you a better answer than what you would've by yourself, specially if you're new to prompting.

The idea here is you can use this GPT to quickly test and iterate your prompts, increasing the quality of answers.

This one is really cool, test it out for something you are interested by and let me know what you think"

If managing such a model does indeed pose more complexity, and chaining models for specific tasks proves to be more efficient for end users, it seems like these transformative efforts would benefit from a comprehensive, collaborative approach.

Just imagine the possibilities if we brought AI engineers, developers, and business experts together to push the boundaries of what a model can achieve. It's rare to find environments where these diverse skill sets intersect, but in places where they do, like ours, the potential for innovation is immense.
