Virginie,Raynaud,Unilabs,FAMH en Chimie Clinique,"Virginie was my lab mate for a full semester and I can tell she is a very impressive, precise and hard-working scientist I've ever had the pleasure to collaborate with. She is an all-around analytical chemist with a strong background in chromatography and spectroscopic methods. She was constantly improving herself by identifying and filling her lack of knowledge and was able to constantly propose solutions to the many problems we encountered.  Virginie's personality is that of a true leader, capable of listening, of maximizing the strengths of her colleagues and being supportive. Always available for a scientific or personal discussion, she is a real charm!  I wish her all the best and expect her to be in a managerial position in a few years.","04/18/18, 05:26 PM",
