## Critical POC Question

**Can we build a comprehensive office automation system that leverages Anthropic's document-skills while adding human-in-the-loop workflows and audit trails?**

## Feasibility Assessment

### Technical Feasibility

**Primary Discovery**: Anthropic already provides comprehensive document processing skills (xlsx, docx, pdf, pptx) and skill creation patterns.

**New Approach**:
1. Integrate Anthropic's existing document-skills
2. Add office automation workflows with human oversight
3. Implement comprehensive audit trails and compliance
4. Create artifact tracking and version control systems

**Confidence Level**: ✅ **HIGH** - Leveraging proven capabilities while adding essential office automation features

### Resource Feasibility

- **Time**: Efficient - leveraging existing Anthropic capabilities
- **Skills**: Python development, office automation workflows, audit systems
- **Infrastructure**: Local development, Anthropic skills integration
- **Dependencies**: Anthropic document-skills, LibreOffice for Excel recalculation

## Architecture Overview

### System Components

1. **Office Automation Integration Layer**: Seamless integration with Anthropic skills
2. **Human-in-the-Loop Workflow System**: Approval processes and audit trails
3. **Artifact Tracking System**: Complete operation history and compliance reporting
4. **Configuration Management**: Centralized system configuration
5. **Document Processing Agents**: Specialized agents for different document types
6. **Test Data Validation**: Excel files for validating system outputs
