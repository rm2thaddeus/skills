# Phase 2: Proof of Concept (POC)

## Purpose

Research feasibility, explore architecture options, conduct technical spikes, and validate the approach before full implementation.

## Outputs

- `POC_PLAN.md`: Feasibility assessment, architecture overview, tech stack, spikes, and research notes
- Code experiments and prototypes (in `Code/` directory)
- UX/UI sketches or mockups

## How to Start

Use this prompt starter:

```
Move to Phase 2. Research feasibility, architecture options, and dependencies.

Output: populate POC_PLAN.md with findings, candidate stacks, and risks.
```

## Checklist

- [ ] Assess technical and resource feasibility
- [ ] Design high-level architecture
- [ ] Select technology stack
- [ ] Define and execute technical spikes
- [ ] Document dependencies
- [ ] Create UX/UI sketches
- [ ] Identify and analyze risks
- [ ] Document key decisions
- [ ] Ready to move to Phase 3 (MVP)

## Technical Spikes

Technical spikes are time-boxed investigations to answer specific questions:

- **Example**: "Can we integrate ChatGPT API with openpyxl for Excel manipulation?"
- **Time Box**: 1-2 hours per spike
- **Output**: Clear answer and code example

## Next Phase

Once POC is validated, proceed to [Phase 3: MVP](../Phase3-MVP/README.md)
