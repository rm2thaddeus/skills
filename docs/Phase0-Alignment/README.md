# Phase 0: Alignment

## Purpose

Establish collaboration norms, understand the user profile, and define the main project idea.

## Outputs

- `PROFILE.yaml`: User profile, technical context, and collaboration preferences
- `CONTEXT.md`: Project background, constraints, goals, and open questions
- **Main Idea**: A single-sentence summary of what we're building

## How to Start

Use this prompt starter with your AI assistant:

```

Output: update PROFILE.yaml and CONTEXT.md.
```
