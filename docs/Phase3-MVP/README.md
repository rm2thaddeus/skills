# Phase 3: MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

## Purpose

Implement a minimal end-to-end prototype with clear requirements, acceptance criteria, and coordinated AI agent roles.

## Outputs

- `PRD.md`: Product Requirements Document with features and acceptance criteria
- `agents.md`: AI agent roles, personas, and coordination patterns
- Prototype code in `Code/` directory
- Setup and deployment instructions
- User documentation

## How to Start

Use this prompt starter:

```
Move to Phase 3. Draft PRD acceptance criteria and define agents/personas.

Output: PRD.md and agents.md with checklists and next actions.
```

## Checklist

- [ ] Complete PRD with functional/non-functional requirements
- [ ] Define user stories with acceptance criteria
- [ ] Establish AI agent roles and coordination
- [ ] Implement core features
- [ ] Write tests (unit, integration, UAT)
- [ ] Create documentation
- [ ] Validate MVP against success metrics
- [ ] Ready for user testing/deployment

## Implementation Approach

### Iterative Development

1. **Sprint 1**: Core functionality
2. **Sprint 2**: Integration and polish
3. **Sprint 3**: Testing and documentation

### Quality Gates

Each feature must pass:
- ✅ All acceptance criteria met
- ✅ Tests passing
- ✅ Code reviewed
- ✅ Documented

## Key Deliverables

1. **Working Prototype**: Functional code demonstrating core features
2. **Test Suite**: Automated tests ensuring reliability
3. **Documentation**: User guides and API documentation
4. **Deployment Guide**: Instructions for setup and deployment

## Success Criteria

The MVP is complete when:
- All high-priority features are implemented
- Core user stories are satisfied
- Test coverage meets targets
- Documentation is comprehensive
- Product is ready for user feedback

## Next Steps

Once MVP is complete:
1. Gather user feedback
2. Iterate based on learnings
3. Plan next version features
