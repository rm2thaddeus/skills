5. **Documentation**: Update relevant docs

### Communication Pattern

```
User Request ‚Üí Architect (high-level plan)
            ‚Üí Backend/Frontend (implementation)
            ‚Üí QA (testing)
            ‚Üí Documentation (docs)
            ‚Üí User Delivery
```

### Handoff Checklist

When passing work between agents:
