# Excel In ChatGPT - Project Guidelines

## Overview

This project follows the **Promptgramming / Translation Hill** methodology for AI-assisted development.

## Core Principles

### 1. Phase-Based Development
- Always check current phase before making changes
- Update frontmatter `updated` field when editing documents
- Maintain links between phase artifacts

### 2. Context Preservation
- All documents include frontmatter with metadata
- Cross-reference related artifacts using links
- Keep PROFILE.yaml and CONTEXT.md up to date

### 3. Iterative Progress
- Make small, targeted edits
- Validate changes against acceptance criteria
- Document decisions in appropriate phase files

## File Organization

### Documentation Structure
```
docs/
├── Phase0-Alignment/    # User profile & context
├── Phase1-Ideation/     # Goals & requirements
├── Phase2-POC/          # Research & architecture
├── Phase3-MVP/          # Implementation & delivery
└── .cursor/rules/       # This file
```

### Code Structure
```
Code/
├── Backend/            # Server-side implementation
└── Frontend/           # Client-side implementation
```

### Resources
```
Data/                   # Excel files and test data
Resources/
├── Documentation/      # PDFs and guides
└── Images/            # Charts and visuals
```

## Development Workflow

### Starting Work
1. Check current phase in project README
2. Read relevant phase README for context
3. Review linked artifacts in frontmatter
4. Make targeted changes

### Completing Work
1. Update `updated` field in frontmatter
2. Check off completed checklist items
3. Document decisions if needed
4. Update main README if phase changes

## AI Agent Coordination

When working on Phase 3 (MVP):
- Reference `docs/Phase3-MVP/agents.md` for role definitions
- Follow agent-specific prompt starters
- Complete handoff checklists when passing work

## Quality Standards

### Code
- Follow existing patterns in codebase
- Write tests for new features
- Document public APIs

### Documentation
- Keep phase documents in sync
- Update frontmatter timestamps
- Maintain cross-reference links

### Commits
- Use conventional commit messages
- Reference phase/artifact in commits
- Keep changes focused and atomic

## Technology Stack

**Language**: Python (for Excel automation)  
**Excel Library**: TBD (openpyxl, pandas, xlwings)  
**AI Integration**: ChatGPT API  
**Testing**: TBD  

## Project-Specific Notes

### Excel Automation Focus
- Test files are in `Data/` directory
- Reference existing PDFs in `Resources/Documentation/`
- Focus on recruitment data processing

### Key Questions to Answer
1. What specific Excel workflows need automation?
2. How will ChatGPT enhance the automation?
3. What are the input/output formats?
4. What validation is required?

## Next Actions

- [ ] Complete Phase 0 alignment
- [ ] Review existing documentation
- [ ] Define specific automation requirements
