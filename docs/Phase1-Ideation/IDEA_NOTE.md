## Refined Idea

Create an **office automation system** that leverages Anthropic's document-skills (especially xlsx) and skill-creator capabilities to solve real-world office tasks. The system will use Claude as an agentic assistant that can process documents, perform data analysis, and generate reports while maintaining human oversight through a structured workflow with audit trails and artifacts.

## Objectives

### Primary Goal

Build a production-ready office automation system that can process Excel documents, perform data analysis, and generate reports using Claude's document-skills capabilities, with comprehensive human oversight and audit trails.

### Secondary Goals

1. Integrate Anthropic's document-skills (xlsx, docx, pdf, pptx) for comprehensive document processing
2. Leverage skill-creator patterns to extend capabilities for specific office workflows
3. Implement human-in-the-loop approval system with clear audit trails
4. Create artifact tracking system for all document transformations and analyses
5. Build standardized workflow patterns for common office automation tasks 

## Success Metrics

- **Functionality**: Successfully processes Excel documents using Anthropic's xlsx skill with zero formula errors
- **Human Oversight**: All document transformations require human approval with clear audit trails
- **Artifact Tracking**: Complete history of all document changes, analyses, and decisions
- **Workflow Efficiency**: Standardized patterns reduce time for common office automation tasks
- **Extensibility**: System can be extended to new document types and workflows using skill-creator patterns 

## Scope

### In Scope

- Integration with Anthropic's document-skills (xlsx, docx, pdf, pptx)
- Human-in-the-loop approval workflows with audit trails
- Artifact tracking and version control for all document operations
- Office automation patterns for common tasks (data analysis, report generation, format conversion)
- Skill extension capabilities using skill-creator patterns
- Test data validation using existing Excel files in Data/ directory

### Out of Scope

- Web interface or GUI (focus on CLI/API integration)
- Real-time data processing (batch processing only)
- Database integration (file-based operations)
- Advanced ML/AI models beyond Claude's capabilities
- Multi-user collaboration features (single-user focus)
- Cloud deployment (local system operation) 

## Key Assumptions

1. **Anthropic Skills Integration**: Document-skills from anthropic-skills repository provide robust Excel/document processing capabilities
2. **Human Oversight Requirement**: All document transformations require human approval for accuracy and compliance
3. **Audit Trail Necessity**: Complete tracking of all operations is essential for office automation trust
4. **Skill Extensibility**: skill-creator patterns enable customization for specific office workflows
5. **File-Based Operations**: Local file processing meets office automation needs without database complexity 

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Document-skills integration issues | High | Medium | Test integration early, maintain fallback to manual processing |
| Human approval bottlenecks | Medium | High | Design efficient approval workflows, batch operations where possible |
| Audit trail complexity | Medium | Medium | Use standardized logging patterns, automated artifact generation |
| Skill customization complexity | Medium | Low | Follow skill-creator patterns, provide clear templates |
| File corruption during processing | High | Low | Implement backup systems, version control, validation checks |

## Dependencies

- **Technical**: 
  - Anthropic's document-skills repository integration
  - Python 3.8+ with pandas, openpyxl, LibreOffice for formula recalculation
  - Claude API access for document processing
  - Git for version control and audit trails
  
- **Resources**: 
  - Existing test data (Excel files in Data/ directory)
  - Anthropic skills documentation and examples
  - Time for integration testing and workflow design
  
- **Knowledge**: 
  - Anthropic skills architecture and usage patterns
  - Office automation workflow design
  - Human-in-the-loop system design principles
  - Audit trail and artifact management best practices 

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Phase 1 complete - objectives and scope defined
2. ⏳ Create comprehensive agents.md file referencing document-skills and skill-creator
3. ⏳ Set up integration between anthropic-skills and local project structure
4. ⏳ Design human-in-the-loop workflow system with audit trails
5. ⏳ Implement artifact tracking and version control system
6. ⏳ Test with existing Excel files in Data/ directory
7. ⏳ Create standardized workflow patterns for common office automation tasks
